### Work description
Pain Creature is a textile-sonic artefact for somaesthetic exploration of chronic pain. Our instrument is the result of a first-person exploration involving soma design methods, auto-ethnographic documentation and daily yoga practice. The result is an interactive fabric musical interface that materializes different aspects of the second author's personal experience with chronic pain. 

The artifact is composed of a central part which can be worn on the back, to which five different textile arms are connected. Each arm materializes a different category of chronic pain experience that has been selected from the author's documentation. The shape, material, weaving technique and sonic interaction design of each arm are a representation of the corresponding somaesthetic experience.
